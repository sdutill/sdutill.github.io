<h2>Hello</h2>
<h3>So there's more than a few reasons I'm choosing to do this.</h3>
<p>
  I've been trying to create something ever since I was a kid. I remember trying
  to write a book when I was in middle school, I remember first starting to
  journal when I was in elementary school. For some reason, even then, I've been
  concerned with losing the person I used to be. I don't even understand it
  really. And this section of text will likely change with time, but that's one
  goal I guess. Self reflection.
</p>
<p>
  The second goal I've actually already stated: I've been trying to be creative
  for so long but always so hesitant. I don't know what stops me from doing so,
  maybe I'll figure it out. I spend so much time online these days and the
  disgust I feel just consuming other people's content without doing anything
  myself may come and go but it never actually fades.
</p>
<p>
  The last thing is probably that I used to be more in touch with myself. I was
  on the path of self actualization and then I just fucking stopped, either b/c
  I was lazy or b/c I was scared of fulfilling my potential or b/c I was ashamed
  of how I was acting at the time. Even off the path I can still remember little
  nuggets that I find truth in and help bring me back. I am REALLY hoping to
  find more of those in these entries as I go through them.
</p>
<p>
  Those are like the high level goals I guess. The spiritual goals. The
  practical goals of this page involve the following:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    It's a blog! But a blog for me, that'll be primarily me going through
    journal entries starting in 2017 through to today and seeinf if my feelings
    have changed.
  </li>
  <li>
    I want to actually learn HTML, CSS, & JavaScript instead of just copy &
    pasting what I find online or whatever an LLM gives me. I may actually
    implement a rule here that there should never be anything copy & pasted
    anywhere in the entire project just as a personal goal. We'll see how long
    that lasts.
  </li>
  <li>
    I want to figure out how to learn a little bit of web design b/c past just
    simple syntax, which can be found online at any time, I have all of these
    immature impulses that I just don't know how to begin to address. Like I'm
    trying to optimize before I know the basics and it's just no bueno. I'm
    thinking that the journal entries should be one directory and then they
    should be loaded in programatically both into like individual pages with the
    linked reflections on the individual page but then there should be one
    single scroll outer page that starts with the most recent entries and then
    has a timeline of all the entries as you scroll. I've got no idea how to do
    that and I should probably create some kind of blueprint for what I'm
    picturing in my head and then upload it to the repo.
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
  First iteration, just b/c there's no reason to delay going through the entries
  and writing my thoughts when I can figure out the design stuff later, is just
  gonna have everything hard coded as HTML probably.
