- Color : Light gold
- Smell : Roasty & sweet
- Taste : Fruity, roasty, delicious

Notes:
The smell is very familiar, and the taste is fruity and pleasant. This is closer to the tea that I think I remember as "oolong".
This is absolutely better than the Red Tiger tea. This going forward is the standard I hae for Oolong. Second time was better than the first, which I believe is b/c I brewed at 95C for 3 min instead of 90C for 2.
