Thailand 'Red Tiger' Oolong Tea
- Color Light blonde 
- Smell - Tea
- Taste: This is so good (First Impression). Later I feel like this is meh.



Notes:
Idk if it's because I haven't had this in a long time, but even the smell of the tea in the bag is great.
Brewed, it's currently indescribable. Slightly musky? I can smell the trash, the sponge smelled weird, and I don't know what's on my hands.
I'm remembering now that some of the joy of this is in the light differences, the stuff you have to be paying attention to notice.

I'm completely ignoring the review on the second pass because it just is like darker idk how to tell the difference yet.

Second Attempt:
Brewing this at 90C for 2:00 is a much better experience, actually an insane difference. Flavor is much more pronounced. 
It's more fruity than musky or like roasted than before, but it's the same exact tea and none of this was there before.

Third Attempt: 
I'm pretty sure this is a little boring
